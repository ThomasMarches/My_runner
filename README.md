# Rules

**My_Runner** is a game where you need to run and dodge wall, kill or dodge ennemies, and make the best score if you are making the infinite mode !

If you want to quit while playing just press esc and click on quit.

## Ennemy precision:

When you shoot an ennemy, there's a % of chance that more than one ennemy dies thanks to the "explosion" of the bullet even if you dont see it.

## Gun precision:

Warning, you can only have one bullet at once ! You will be able to shoot again once the bullet has destroyed an ennemy or went too far.
## Start the game.

Use the **makefile** to build the game.

```bash
make
```

Use the lauching game command and choose which map you want to play on inside the folder "_map_".

```bash
./my_runner -i to play infinite mode
./my_runner map/map to play on a certain map
```
